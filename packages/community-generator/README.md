# community-generator

The community-generator plugin is provides a way for users to filter resources on the training resources page, without javascript or a web backend. It accomplushes this by generating a set of lektor contents files for each combination of filters.

You shouldn't need to do anything or know anything about this plugin in order to use it.

## Developing

The plugin has a few different pieces:

- The main generation logic, which resides in the `community-generator/lektor_community_generator/` directory.
- lektor templates: `empty.html`, `resources-sortby.html` `resources_filter.html`
- a lektor model `sortby_resources.ini` generated by the plugin, and added to the top-level .gitignore
- a set of generated lektor contents files, in `content/training/resources/sortby/`
- a `content/training/resources/.gitignore` file, ignoring the generated lektor contents files

If you want to change what's in the generated contents.lr files, look into the `lektor_community_generator/file_templates.py` file, and the `generate_files` function in `lektor_community_generator/__init__.py`.

If you want to change the model of the generated contents files, look at `lektor_community_generator/file_templates.py`

If you want to change the templates, look into the `reousrces-sortby.html`, `resources_filter.html`, and `resources_list.html` templates

OONI Probe is a free software project that aims to uncover internet censorship around the world. As part of this project you would be working on improving censorship detection while making the OONI infrastructure more resilient.

# Background

The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) is a free software project which aims to empower decentralized efforts in increasing transparency of internet censorship around the world.

We develop free and open source software, called OONI Probe, that users can run to measure:

- Blocking of websites;
- Blocking of instant messaging apps (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Telegram);
- Blocking of censorship circumvention tools (such as Tor);
- Presence of systems (middleboxes) in your network that might be responsible for censorship and/or surveillance;
- Speed and performance of your network.

By running OONI Probe, users can collect data that can potentially serve as evidence of internet censorship since it shows how, when, where, and by whom it is implemented.

# Proposal

Test helpers are endpoints used by the OONI Probes to detect censorship. The main goal of the project is to improve censorship detection while making the OONI infrastructure more resilient. The main activities are:

1. Deploy and integrate new test helpers based on the probe codebase.
1. Automate deployment and rotation of test helpers on various public clouds.
1. Implement forwarding methods to use the test helpers as proxies for the collector API.
1. Safely serve metadata about the test collectors through the API.

- **Prerequisites:** Understanding of Networking, Security, OS, basics of cloud services

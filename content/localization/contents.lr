##Localization is how we reach a global community.

In order for Tor to work for everyone, it needs to speak everyone's languages.
Our volunteer translation team works hard to make this a reality, and we can always use more help.
Our current translation priorities are translating [Tor Browser](https://torpat.ch/locales), Tor Browser documentation, and the [Tor Project website](https://torpat.ch/tpo-locales), but there are many other documents that we could use help translating as well.

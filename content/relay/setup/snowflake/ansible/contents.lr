Other ways to install ansible [Installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

### Download ansible role from the Galaxy repository

```
ansible-galaxy install nvjacobo.snowflake
```

Galaxy repository  where users can share roles, and to a command line tool for installing, creating and managing roles.

### Creating the playbook site.yml

```
- hosts: snowflake
  roles:
      - nvjacobo.snowflake
```

An Ansible playbook is an organized unit of scripts that defines work for a server configuration managed by the automation tool Ansible.

### Creation of our inventory file

```
[snowflake]
ip-address
```
Inventory represents the set of machines that Ansible will automatically manage through the playbooks.

### Running our playbook

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml -u root
```

Or with sudo

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml -u username -b
```

## Managing snowflake proxy with systemd on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, ArchLinux via Ansible

Status snowflake proxy

```
ansible all -i inventory -a 'systemctl status snowflake-proxy'
```
Start snowflake proxy

```
ansible all -i inventory -a 'systemctl start snowflake-proxy'
```

Stop snowflake proxy

```
ansible all -i inventory -a 'systemctl stop snowflake-proxy'
```

## Managing snowflake proxy with rc script on FreeBSD

Status snowflake proxy

```
ansible all -i inventory -a 'service snowflake status'
```

Start snowflake proxy

```
ansible all -i inventory -a 'service snowflake start'
```

Stop snowflake proxy

```
ansible all -i inventory -a 'service snowflake stop'
```
## Upgrade snowflake proxy version via Afnsible

To update to the latest snowflake version available it is necessary to run our playbook again.

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml -u root
```

## Variables

Role Variables (not for FreeBSD). You can set the number of clients for your proxy by clients variable. Maximum concurrent clients by default is 0 = non limit.

### Example Playbook site.yml with Variable clients

```
- hosts: snowflake
   vars:
    clients: 300
  roles:
     - nvjacobo.snowflake
```
The above playbook has a limit of 300 concurrent clients.

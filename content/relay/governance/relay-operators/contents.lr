Relay operators form the backbone of the Tor network, facilitating anonymous and secure internet browsing for users worldwide. 
Operating a relay involves running specialized software that routes encrypted traffic through a series of relays, protecting user privacy and security. 

In the past, our approach to organizing the Tor relay operator community relied heavily on the informal dynamics between [relay operators](/relay/governance/relay-operators/becoming-relay-operator), [Directory Authorities](/relay/governance/policies-and-proposals/directory-authority-policy), and The Tor Project staff. 
Now, through discussions and interactions in meetups and similar events, we collaborate with operators to determine best practices for managing Tor relays. 
This is beneficial to both user safety and the continued effectiveness of [Directory Authorities](/relay/governance/policies-and-proposals/directory-authority) and The Tor Project.

Relay operators contribute valuable bandwidth and computing resources to the network, enabling Tor users to access the internet anonymously.

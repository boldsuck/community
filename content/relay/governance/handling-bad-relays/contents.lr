Having [processes to handle bad relays](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/network-health/team/-/wikis/Bad-relay-work) in open networks like the Tor network is crucial to maintaining user privacy and security.
Malicious actors may attempt to join the network to attack Tor users.
To counter these threats, the Network Health team within the Tor Project actively detects and prevents such malicious efforts.

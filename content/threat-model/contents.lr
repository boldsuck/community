The Tor network, designed to safeguard privacy and enable anonymous communication, is constantly under threat from adversaries who seek to exploit its vulnerabilities. 
As an open and decentralized system, Tor relies on a global network of volunteer-operated relays, making it both resilient and a target for various forms of attacks. 
These threats range from malicious relays attempting to disrupt traffic or compromise user anonymity, to sophisticated surveillance tactics aimed at deanonymizing users or undermining the networkâ€™s integrity.

To defend against these threats, it is important to understand the types of attackers the network faces, their capabilities, and their objectives. 
A comprehensive threat model helps to identify potential vulnerabilities, assess the risks, and design appropriate mitigation strategies to protect both users and the network itself. 

In this section, we provide a detailed overview of the adversaries targeting Tor, their methods of attack, and the systems in place to counter them, helping Tor continue to serve as a secure platform for privacy-conscious users.

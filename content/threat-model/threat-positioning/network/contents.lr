Network attackers pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of the network. 
These attackers are those who run or compromise relays within the network, or manipulate traffic to exploit weaknesses in the Tor protocol. 
Their goal may be to deanonymize users, degrade network performance, or damage Tor’s reputation.

## How Network Adversaries attack Tor

Network adversaries can carry out a variety of attacks, which can generally fall into three broad categories: 
running malicious relays that risks user safety and security, manipulating Tor’s protocol to leak information, and performing denial of service (DoS) attacks.

### 1. Running Malicious Relays

Network attackers often run relays that are configured to harm the network or users in some way. 
[Malicious relays](/relay/governance/handling-bad-relays/) can be designed to:

- Spy on traffic passing through them.
- Disrupt communication between Tor users and the network.
- Collect data that can be used to deanonymize users.

Malicious relays may also be purposefully misconfigured to introduce vulnerabilities into the network. 
These relays might not follow proper protocol, resulting in traffic that leaks information, making it easier to track users. 

An attacker could operate a malicious exit relay—the final node where traffic exits the Tor network and reaches the open internet—
intentionally designed to steal sensitive data like cryptocurrencies, hijack online accounts, log user activity, or exploit vulnerabilities in Tor's protocol. 
This allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate traffic, posing significant risks to users relying on Tor for secure, anonymous browsing.

Tor actively works to detect and remove these relays, but attackers often attempt to bypass detection 
by concealing the true nature of their relays, such as lying about key relay properties or frustrating Tor’s scanning efforts.

### 2. Exploiting Information Leaks

Tor’s protocol, while designed to protect user anonymity, has known information leaks or "[side channels](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/blob/main/proposals/344-protocol-info-leaks.txt)" that attackers can exploit. 
A network adversary running relays can take advantage of these leaks to:

- Deanonymize users directly by correlating traffic patterns between the entry and exit points of the Tor network.
- Assist other deanonymization attempts by providing additional data that makes it easier to confirm which traffic belongs to a specific user.

These information leaks are detailed in [*Proposal 344*](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/blob/main/proposals/344-protocol-info-leaks.txt), which highlights the severity of each one. 
While not all require running relays to exploit, network adversaries who operate relays are in a better position to see more traffic and perform traffic analysis, making their attacks more effective.

### 3. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

Network adversaries can also use DoS attacks to degrade the performance of the Tor network, making it slow or unreliable. 
These attacks might:

- Exploit vulnerabilities in the Tor protocol to generate large amounts of traffic, overwhelming the network.
- Use external services to flood the network with traffic, causing congestion.

The goal of a DoS attack is often to discourage users from using Tor by making it so slow or unusable that they switch to less secure alternatives. 
A DoS attack can also frustrate volunteers running relays, potentially leading them to shut down their relays, which weakens the network and makes it more vulnerable to further attacks.


The presence of malicious or misconfigured relays, along with the potential for DoS attacks, can severely undermine Tor’s security, reliability, and reputation. 
If users perceive the network as unsafe or slow, they may stop using it, reducing the overall anonymity of the network (since more users make it harder to track individual traffic). 

As the Tor project relies on volunteers for relays and external funding, 
frequent attacks could discourage operators and impact funding, both critical for keeping the network operational.

While Tor has systems in place to detect and remove these threats, attackers are constantly evolving their tactics to avoid detection and weaken the network. 
A deeper understanding of these threats and continuous vigilance are essential to maintaining the security and usability of the Tor network.

#### slide ####
title: What is Tor?
----
description:
- Tor is free software and an open network.
- Mitigates against tracking, surveillance and censorship.
- Run by a US non-profit and volunteers from all over the world.
- It's Tor, not TOR.


#### slide ####
title: The Tor network
----
description:
- An open network that everyone can be a part of.
- The network is composed of different types of servers run by volunteers around the world.
- Your server will relay the Tor traffic to another server on the Internet.
- Before entering the network, your server will automatically go through the relay lifecycle.


#### slide ####
title: Why run a Tor relay?
----
description:
By running a Tor relay, you can help make the Tor network:
- faster (and therefore more usable)
- more robust against attacks
- more stable in case of outages
- safer for users (spying on more relays is harder than on a few)

title: Guard/middle (aka non-exit) relay
----
description:
- A guard is the first relay in the chain of 3 relays building a Tor circuit.
- A middle relay is neither a guard nor an exit, but acts as the second hop between them.
- To become a guard, a middle relay has to be stable and fast (at least 2MByte/s); otherwise, it will remain a middle relay.


#### slide ####
title: Exit relay
----
description:
- The exit relay is the final relay in a Tor circuit, and sends the traffic to its destination.
- That is why exit relays have the most significant legal exposure and liability of all relays.
- Before running an exit relay, talk with your local digital rights organization.
- **You should not run a Tor exit relay from your home.**


#### slide ####
title: Bridge
----
description:
- A bridge is a node in the network that is not listed in the public Tor directory, making it harder for ISPs and governments to block it.
- Bridges are relatively easy, low-risk, and low bandwidth Tor relays to operate.
- And there's another special kind of bridge: Pluggable transports. These hide your Tor traffic by adding a layer of obfuscation.


#### slide ####
title: The lifecycle of a new relay
----
description:
Non-exit relays go through a lifecycle of four phases (defined in days):
- Days 0-3: the unmeasured phase.
- Days 3-8: network authorities start the remote measurement phase (the ramp-up guard phase).
- Days 8-68: guard phase (where load counter intuitively drops and then rises higher).


#### slide ####
title: The lifecycle of a new relay
----
description:
- After 68 days, if stable and fast enough, the relay will receive a **Guard flag** (steady-state guard phase).
- Read about all the phases in: <https://blog.torproject.org/lifecycle-new-relay>

#### slide ####
title: Before we start
----
description:
- Never run a relay without the consent of the network administrator or machine owner.
  Read the Terms of Service (ToS) first, so you don’t risk losing money.
- Choose which type of relay you will host. A non-exit relay is an easy way to start helping the network.
- Read the documentation: <https://community.torproject.org/relay>


#### slide ####
title: Bandwidth requirements
----
description:
- It’s recommended to have at least 16 Mbit/s (Mbps) upload and download bandwidth available for Tor. More is better.
- The minimum requirements for a relay are 10 Mbit/s (Mbps).
- If you have less than 10 Mbit/s but at least 1 Mbit/s, we recommend running a bridge with obfs4 support.


#### slide ####
title: Monthly outbound traffic
----
description:
- Relays must use at least 100 GByte of outbound/incoming traffic per month.
- If you have a metered plan, you might want to configure Tor to use only a given amount of bandwidth or monthly traffic.
- More (>2 TB/month) is better and recommended.


#### slide ####
title: Public IPv4 address
----
description:
- Every relay needs a public IPv4 address - either directly on the host (preferred) or via NAT and port forwarding.
- The IPv4 address is not required to be static, but static IP addresses are preferred.
- Your IPv4 address should remain unchanged for at least 3 hours (network consensus).
- You can only run two Tor relays per public IPv4.


#### slide ####
title: Other requirements
----
description:
- Memory: A <40 Mbit/s non-exit relay should have at least 512 MB of RAM available.
- Disk storage: Tor does not need much disk storage. A typical Tor relay needs less than 200 MB.


#### slide ####
title: Other requirements
----
description:
- Any modern CPU should be fine.
- Uptime: Ideally, the relay runs on a server which runs 24/7.


#### slide ####
title: Choosing your relay hosting
----
description:
- The Tor community team maintains GoodBadISPs – a list about the experience of running relays: <https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/good-bad-isps/>
- Some providers only allow non-exit relays, so check the GoodBadISPs list before buying a service.
- Running a relay can cost anywhere between a few bucks to hundreds per month.

title: Tips for running an exit relay
----
description:
- Get a separate IP for the relay, and don’t use it for other services.
- Set up a Tor Exit Notice, so if someone checks your exit IP they'll know that it’s a Tor Exit.
- If you receive excessive complaints, consider running a Reduced Exit Policy.

- Some organizations – known as Relay Associations – are solely dedicated to this purpose: <https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/relay-associations/>.


#### slide ####
title: Relays associations
----
description:
- It's often advised to create some type of non-profit organization. This is useful for having a bank account and shared ownership.
- The most important thing is to have a group of people (3-5 suggested to start) interested in helping.

title: What is a bad relay?
----
description:
- A bad relay is one that either doesn't work properly or tampers with our users' connections. That can be either through maliciousness or misconfiguration.


#### slide ####
title: What is a bad relay?
----
description:
- For example: tampering with exit traffic in any way (including dropping accepted connections). Or, running HSDirs that harvest and probe .onion addresses


#### slide ####
title: Reporting a bad relay
----
description:
- The "Bad relays" private working group at the Tor Project work to detect misconfigured, malicious, or suspicious relays.
- Users can report bad relays by sending an email to bad-relays@lists.torproject.org with the relay’s IP address or fingerprint, what kind of behavior you see, and any additional information needed to reproduce the issue.


#### slide ####
title: What happens to bad relays?
----
description:
- After a relay is reported and behavior has been verified, the Tor Project will attempt to contact the relay operator.
- The relay will be flagged to prevent it from being used (BadExit, Invalid, Reject).
- The working group actively looks for bad relays using open source tools like exitmap, sysbilhunter.
